## 🚀 Getting Started

### ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Setup MuseCraftEngine First**

Before using MuseCraft Studio's AI features, you **MUST** set up and run the MuseCraftEngine backend:

**🔗 [MuseCraftEngine Repository](https://github.com/WebChatAppAi/MuseCraftEngine)**

#### Quick Engine Setup:
```bash
# 1. Clone the engine
git clone https://github.com/WebChatAppAi/MuseCraftEngine.git
cd MuseCraftEngine

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Download AI models from HuggingFace
# Visit: https://huggingface.co/projectlosangeles/MuseCraft/tree/main
# Download .pth files and place them in: ./data/models/

# 4. Start the engine
python main.py
```

✅ **Verify engine is running**: Visit http://localhost:8899/docs

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** and **pnpm** (recommended) or npm
- **MuseCraftEngine Backend** running on `http://localhost:8899` ⬆️
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### Quick Start (After Engine Setup)

**⚠️ Make sure MuseCraftEngine is running first!**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WebChatAppAi/MuseCraft-Studio.git
cd MuseCraft-Studio

# 2. Install dependencies  
pnpm install
# or: npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 3. Start the application (ensure engine is running on localhost:8899)
pnpm dev
```

### First-Time Application Setup

#### Step 0: **CRITICAL - Ensure Backend is Ready**
🚨 **Before launching MuseCraft Studio, you MUST have:**
1. ✅ **MuseCraftEngine running** on http://localhost:8899
2. ✅ **AI models downloaded** from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/projectlosangeles/MuseCraft/tree/main)
3. ✅ **Models placed** in `MuseCraftEngine/data/models/` directory

**Without the engine, AI features will not work!**

#### Step 1: Launch MuseCraft Studio
The application opens to the **Quantum Landing** page with a beautiful animated welcome interface.

#### Step 2: Navigate to AI Setup  
Click "AI Setup" in the sidebar to access the model management hub:
- **Test Backend Connection**: Verify MuseCraftEngine is running on localhost:8899
- **Discover Models**: Automatically scan for available AI models from your engine
- **Load Model**: Select and load your preferred model into memory  
- **Monitor Status**: Real-time WebSocket updates show model loading progress

#### Step 3: Access the Piano Roll Studio
Navigate to "Piano Roll" to enter the main composition workspace:
- **Grid Area**: Visual MIDI note representation with canvas-based rendering
- **Piano Keyboard**: Left sidebar with note names and octave navigation
- **Timeline**: Top ruler showing measures, beats, and time positions
- **AI Toolbar**: Right panel with generation controls and parameters
- **Velocity Lane**: Bottom area for editing note dynamics

#### Step 4: Generate Your First Composition
1. **Configure AI Parameters**: Set creativity level, note count, and musical style
2. **Click "Generate"**: AI creates notes based on your parameters
3. **Real-time Updates**: Watch generation progress via WebSocket notifications
4. **Edit Results**: Refine generated notes using the professional editor tools
