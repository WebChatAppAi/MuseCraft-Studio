# GitHub Actions Prebuild Fix 🔧

## Issue Identified ❌

The Windows build in GitHub Actions was failing with this error:
```
⨯ Cannot find package.json in the D:\a\MuseCraft-Studio\MuseCraft-Studio\node_modules\.dev
```

## Root Cause Analysis 🔍

The problem occurred because:

1. **Missing Prebuild Step**: The workflow was running `pnpm run compile:app` but not the complete `pnpm run prebuild` process
2. **Package.json Not Generated**: electron-builder requires a package.json file in `node_modules/.dev/main/` directory
3. **Incomplete Build Process**: The `compile:packageJSON` step was missing, which creates the distribution package.json

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. **Fixed Build Process**
```yaml
# Before (Incomplete):
- name: 🏗️ Build application
  run: |
    pnpm run compile:app

# After (Complete):
- name: 🏗️ Build application (prebuild)  
  run: |
    pnpm run prebuild  # Runs: clean:dev + compile:app + compile:packageJSON
```

### 2. **Added Verification Step**
```yaml
- name: 🔍 Verify prebuild output
  run: |
    if (Test-Path "node_modules\.dev\main\package.json") {
      echo "✅ package.json found in .dev directory"
    } else {
      echo "❌ package.json not found!"
      exit 1
    }
```

## Build Process Flow 🔄

### Complete Prebuild Process:
1. **`pnpm run clean:dev`** - Cleans previous build artifacts
2. **`pnpm run compile:app`** - Compiles TypeScript and builds application
3. **`pnpm run compile:packageJSON`** - Generates package.json for electron-builder

### Files Created:
- ✅ `node_modules/.dev/main/index.js` - Compiled main process
- ✅ `node_modules/.dev/preload/index.js` - Compiled preload script  
- ✅ `node_modules/.dev/renderer/` - Compiled renderer files
- ✅ **`node_modules/.dev/main/package.json`** - **Required by electron-builder**
- ✅ `node_modules/.dev/trusted-dependencies-scripts.json` - Dependencies config

## Expected Results 🎯

With this fix, the GitHub Actions workflow should now:

1. ✅ **Complete Prebuild**: Run full prebuild process including package.json generation
2. ✅ **Verify Files**: Confirm all required files exist before building
3. ✅ **Build Successfully**: electron-builder finds package.json and proceeds normally
4. ✅ **Create Executables**: Generate Windows installer and portable versions
5. ✅ **Upload Artifacts**: Successfully upload built files to GitHub

## Testing Instructions 📝

To test this fix:

1. **Push Changes**: Commit and push the updated workflow
2. **Trigger Build**: Either push to main or manually trigger via GitHub Actions
3. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for these successful steps:
   - ✅ Prebuild completes without errors
   - ✅ Verification step confirms package.json exists
   - ✅ electron-builder runs successfully
   - ✅ Windows executables are created

## Files Modified 📄

- ✅ **`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`** - Fixed prebuild process
- ✅ **`PREBUILD_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** - This documentation

## Key Learning 🧠

**Important**: For Electron applications using a custom build process, always run the complete prebuild chain that includes:
- Application compilation
- **Package.json generation for the distribution build**
- Dependencies configuration

Missing any step can cause electron-builder to fail with "Cannot find package.json" errors.
